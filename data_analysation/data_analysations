ANALYSING DATA ON CORRELATIONS, DEPENDENCIES AND SIMILARITIES

ITEM - USER
° how often every item gets ordered again from the same user (in different orders, at different times)
° how often every item gets ordered in general (total order count for every item)
° reorder frequency for every item (for specific user / in general)
° correlation between reorder frequency and total number of orders
° correlation between reorder frequency and how often a item gets reordered
° dependencies between user and items the user buy  |\
° how many users buy a specific item                | \-> maybe useful to avoid the cold start Problem

ITEM - CATEGORY
° dependencies between items in the same category
    - items often share the same feature/brand values for ~75% of the features/brand
° dependencies between items in the same categories and there parent categories
° dependencies between items in the same parent category

USER - CATEGORY
° dependencies between the categories of the items a user order
